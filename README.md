# 2D-to-3D
System that converts a single 2D image into a 3D model using Depth Anything model to predict depth image then constructing point cloud and 3D mesh of the image.

## Usage
Upload an Image: Visit the web interface and upload an image file (.png, .jpg, .jpeg).

Wait for Processing: The system will process the image, predict the depth, and generate a point cloud.

Download the 3D Model: Once the model is reconstructed, the .obj file can be downloaded directly from the browser.
